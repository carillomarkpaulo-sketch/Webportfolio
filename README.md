This Resume/Portfolio Website was created for a Basic Web Development activity. 
It utilizes a simple, functional design to present comprehensive personal data. The site includes detailed sections for my resume, work experience, and education. 
Key features are a dedicated section for acquired skills, a carousel for showcasing certifications, and a complete footer with contact details and social media links
(LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.).

This project is designed for easy review. To run the site locally, I recommend using the VS Code Live Server extension. 
Once installed, simply right-click the main HTML file (e.g., index.html) and select 'Open with Live Server' to launch the site with automatic browser refresh capabilities.
